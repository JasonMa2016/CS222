CS222 final project


/filters contains the basic Bloom Filter and learning model(CNN) implementations.

All tests currently run on the shirts data set.

BF.py tests a basic BF model given a desired FPR rate to be achieved.

LBF.py tests a LBF model given a desired FPR rate to be achieved(data set dependent) and tau. 

SBF.py tests a SBF model given a deisred FPR rate to be achieved(data set dependent) and tau.

SBF_tau.py tests the same learning model + SBF with different cutoff value tau.
